          Tor Bandwidth Measurements Document Format
                            juga

1. Scope and preliminaries

  This document describes the format of Tor's bandwidth measurements
  document, version 1.1.0 and later.

  Since Tor version 0.2.4.12-alpha the directory
  authorities use the bandwidth measurements document called
  "V3BandwidthsFile" and produced by Torflow [1]
  (format described in README.spec.txt [2]).

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    RFC 2119.

1.2. Acknowledgements

  The original bandwidth measurement scanner (Torflow) and format was
  created by mike. Teor suggested to write this specification while
  contributing on pastly's new bandwidth scanner implementation.

  This specification was revised after feedback from:

    Teor

1.3 Outline

  The bandwidth measurements mentioned in sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2
  of "Tor directory protocol" (dir-spec.txt) [3] are obtained
  by bandwidth authorities, which generate a file storing information
  on relays' measured bandwidth capacities.

2. Format details

  Bandwidth measurements MUST contain the following sections:
  - Header (exactly once)
  - Relays measurements (zero or more times)

2.1. Definitions

  The following nonterminals are defined in dir-spec.txt, sections
  1.2., 2.1.1., 2.1.3. :

    Int
    SP (space)
    NL (newline)
    Keyword
    ArgumentChar
    fingerprint (hexdigest)
    nickname

  Nonterminals defined in "Tor Directory List Format" (dir-list-spec.txt),
  section 2.2.1.:

    version_number

  We define the following nonterminals:

    value ::= ArgumentChar+
    key_value ::= Keyword "=" value
    line := ArgumentChar* NL
    timestamp = Int

2.2. Header format

It consists of:

  timestamp NL

    [At start, exactly once.]

    The Unix Epoch time in seconds when the file was created.

  "version="version_number NL

    [In second position, zero or one time.]

    The specification document format version.

    New implementations SHOULD include this line.
    For documents generated following this specification,
    the version_number MUST be "1.1.0".
    Documents generated before this specification do not contain this line,
    and the version_number is considered to be "1.0.0".
    This line is ignored by any Tor version released before this specification.
    TODO: implement this feature in tor

  Future releases may include additional header lines.
  Parsers MUST NOT rely on the order of these additional lines.
  Additional header lines will be accompanied by a minor version increment.
  If a header line does conform to this format, the line SHOULD be ignored by
  parsers.
  This section ends when a relay measurement is found conforming to the next
  section.
  TODO: check that it is what tor does

2.3. Relay measurements format

  It consists of zero or more lines that contain the measurement results
  of relays in arbitrary order.
  There can be at most one such line per relay identity (fingerprint).
  Each line MUST consists of the following fields in arbitrary order:

    "node_id=" fingerprint SP
    "bw=" bandwidth SP

  Where:

    bandwidth = Int

    The aggregated measured bandwidth of this relay, in kilobytes
    per second.

  Each line MUST accept additional Arguments as stated in the dir-spec.txt
  Document meta format.
  If additional Arguments are included, they MUST by key_value.
  Each line MUST end with NL.

  For instance, every relay measurement in sbws version 0.1.0 consist of:

    "node_id=" fingerprint SP
    "bw=" bandwidth SP
    "nick=" nickname SP
    "rtt=" rtt SP
    "time=" timestamp NL

  Where:

    timestamp = Int

    The Unix Epoch time in seconds when the measurement was performed.

    rtt = Int

    The Round Trip Time in microseconds to obtain 1 Byte of data.

  Torflow includes node_id and bw among others [2].
